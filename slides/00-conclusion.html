### My Thoughts
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Reminder: Course Description

- A second course in computing with an emphasis on foundational data structures and program analysis. The course provides a comprehensive look at the Java programming language including object oriented programming, concurrency, inheritance / polymorphism. Additionally, foundational data structures and related algorithms / analysis are studied. These include Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, and Priority Queues.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Python vs. Java

- I thought the python vs. Java issue was not as pronounced this semester.
  - What did you think?
  - Python folks: Did the transition go ok? Did you feel ok picking up Java?
  - Java folks: Were you bored? Did you still feel challenged in the course?
- Maybe having a bigger class, cohorts, etc. made this a bit better.
</script></section>


<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Reminder of Course Goals

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
- Understand how to write programs in Java, including all basic structures (e.g., if-statements, loops, functions), recursion, objects, methods, inheritance / polymorphism, and exception throwing / handling.
- Understand and implement several key data structures, required for a foundational education in computer science. These data structures include Vectors, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, and Priority Queues.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Goals (2)

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
- Understand and implement various sorting methods, including bubble sort, insertion sort, mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort.
- Understand and analyze program analysis using practical approaches (e.g., mergesort vs. quicksort) and theoretical approaches (e.g., balanced vs. unbalanced search trees). This will include both space and time complexity analyses.
- Gather an abstract and basic understanding of concurrency and associated issues (shared resources, etc.). Students will be able to implement simple multi-threaded programs in Java. 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Modules

- The course is split into 12 modules
  - You can find the list [here](../slides/index.html)
- Lectures will go through these modules one at a time.
- The modules help you keep the course content organized.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Modules 1

- Basic Java 1
  - Basic programs, data types, functions
- Basic Java 2
  - Ifs, loops, Arrays, References, Parameter Passing
- Basic Java 3
  - Objects, Classes
  - Generic types
  - Inheritence / Enums / Interfaces / Polymorphism
  - Java Collections / Etc.
  - Exceptions / IDEs / Debugging / JVM / Compilers'
- Vectors (versus Arrays, Abstract Data Types)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Material 2

- Other Lists
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Big OH and Recursion
  - Definitions / Function relationships
  - Analyzing Programs
  - How to think recursively
- Trees
  - Structure / Binary Tree / Recursive Traversals
  - BST and operations
  - Balanced trees (AVL and Red-Black)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Material 3
- Basic Sorting
  - Slow sorts (insertion / bubble)
- Advanced Sorts  
  - Fast sorts (merge, quick, heap)
  - Hybrid sorts (TimSort, etc.)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Material 4
- Hash Tables
  - Operations / Structure
  - Hash functions
  - Collision Resolution
- Priority Queues
  - Structure / Operations
  - Min-Heap / Array Implementation
  - Analysis
- Basic Concurrence
  - Threading, Deadlocks, etc.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Things that I already know could be improved
- A couple assignments are a bit too difficult
  - Hash Tables, maybe AVL, and maybe Heaps as well.
  - We have ideas on ways to make these just a bit easier.
- Try to make sure every analysis can be done even if implementation not complete
  - This is not true for some of the assignments.
- Reorder some topics:
  - e.g., sorting before trees, so you see compareTo before BST.

### Getting your feedback
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Feedback on...

- The module system
- The course structure / schedule
- The topics we covered (this isn't going to change but still interested)
- The pace of lectures / topics
- etc...
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Feedback on...

- Homeworks
  - Implementations. Were they useful? Did you become a better coder?
  - Analyses: Were these helpful. Purpose was to see the theory in practice.
  - Any homeworks that you particularly liked or disliked?
    - Hash table one? What made this so hard?
    - How did you like the Roomba and Blackjack (open-ended) ones?
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Feedback on...

- Quizzes
  - The process of doing them in labs.
  - The grading scheme / retake policy
  - The length and difficulty
  - etc.
- Labs
  - Not many people stuck around in lab. 
  - Thoughts on improving this?
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Late Policy

- Purpose was to be lenient, encourage you to complete homeworks with minimal penalty.
  - Thoughts on this?
  - Too lenient?
  - Just right?
  - Changes?

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Thank you for a good semester

- It was a really enjoyable semester. This group gave me a good laugh on a regular basis and you were a really good group. I'll always remember our clapping culture (for example).
- Thank you for working so hard! I hope you pushed yourself to be a better Computer Scientist. I hope you felt challenged and then rewarded.
- The goal is for this class to be somewhat difficult, and to transition you into the "harder" CS classes. I feel like we struck that balance. I hope you feel that way too.
