<p>The repository contains content for CS2501 - Data Structures and
Algorithms I at <a href="https://virginia.edu">the University of
Virginia</a>. This course was originally part of the Computer Science
department’s <a href="https://pilot.cs.virginia.edu">curriculum
pilot</a>. Starting in the Spring 2022 semester, it will become a new
core course for all Computer Science Majors at UVa.</p>

to this Repository</h2>
<p>Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals
only, to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a
lecture. However, others can still contribute to this repository – to do
so, take the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a github account, if you do not have one</li>
<li>Fork this repository: you can click on the “Fork” link in the upper
right, or just click <a
href="https://github.com/uva-cs/dsa1/fork">here</a></li>
<li>Clone your forked repository on to your local machine</li>
<li>Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and
push your changes back to your forked repository</li>
<li>Create a pull request, following the instructions <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">here</a></li>
</ol>
<p>At that point, I will receive a notice that a change has been
submitted, and I’ll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main
repository.</p>
<p>When you want to bring in the updates from the main dsa1 github
repository into your forked repository, you will need to follow the

<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course
Description</h2>
<p>A second course in computing with an emphasis on foundational data
structures and program analysis. The course provides a comprehensive
look at the Java programming language including object oriented
programming, concurrency, inheritance / polymorphism. Additionally,
foundational data structures and related algorithms / analysis are
studied. These include Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, and
Priority Queues.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a> course objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will understand how to write programs in Java, including
all basic structures (e.g., if-statements, loops, functions), recursion,
objects, methods, inheritance / polymorphism, and exception throwing /
handling.</li>
<li>Students will understand and implement several key data structures,
required for a foundational education in computer science. These data
structures include Vectors, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search
Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, and Priority Queues.</li>
<li>Students will understand and be able to implement various sorting
methods, including bubble sort, insertion sort, mergesort, quicksort,
and heapsort.</li>
<li>Students will be able to understand and analyze program analysis
using practical approaches (e.g., mergesort vs. quicksort) and
theoretical approaches (e.g., balanced vs. unbalanced search trees).
This will include both space and time complexity analyses.</li>
<li>Students will gather an abstract, and basic understanding of
concurrency and associated issues (shared resources, etc.). Students
will be able to implement simple multi-threaded programs in Java.</li>
</ul>
